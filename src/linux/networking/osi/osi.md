# OSI MODEL

>OSI - Open Systems Interconnection and consist of 7 layers.

It describes how information from a software application in one computer moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer

## Application Layer
- Only layer that directly interacts with data from the user
- Protocols 
    - HTTP
    - FTP
    - SMTP
    - POP
## Presentation Layer
- it defines how two devices should *encode*, *encrypt*, and *compress* data, so it is received correctly on the other end
## Session Layer
- it creates communication channels (*sessions*)
- ensure channel is open till the communication ends
## Transport Layer
- it takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into “segments” on the transmitting end 
- viceversa to the above process at receiving end
- responsible for flow control and error control 
## Network Layer
- takes segments from transport layer and makes it into “packets”
- routing occurs here, i.e. it finds best physical path to transfer the data to destination
- used in communication b/w different networks
## Data Link Layer
- takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into smaller pieces called as “frames”
- used in communication b/w same network
## Physical Layer
- physical cable or wireless connection between network nodes
- data gets converted into a bit stream, which is a string of 1s and 0s.

# What is meant by hop to hop and end to end delivery?


>- Layer 2 (*Data Layer*) uses MAC addresses and is responsible for packet delivery from hop to hop.
>- Layer 3 (*Network Layer*) uses IP addresses and is responsible for packet delivery from end to end.

Notice between each Router, the MAC address header is stripped and regenerated to get it to the next hop. The IP header generated by the first computer is only stripped off by the final computer, hence the IP header handled the “end to end” delivery, and each of the four different MAC headers involved in this animation handled the “hop to hop” delivery.

# How transport layer of the OSI model is responsible for distinguishing network streams?
Consider we are using 3 different services like messenger, browser and a music streaming application on same computer. 
Data comes to the Transport layer in the form of 1'sand 0's. 
So, it is necessary to distingusish the data packets to the correct application.

>Transport layer accomplishes this by using an addressing scheme known as *Port Numbers*

-  2 methods of distinguishing network streams exist
    - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
    - User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
