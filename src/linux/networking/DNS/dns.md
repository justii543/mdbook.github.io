# DNS
>Domain Names are the simple human-readable names for websites. The Internet understands only IP addresses but humans give names for that IP address.

## DNS Resolution
When someone tries to use *google.com*, the browser tries to convert this by passing it through different layers and finally fetches the IP address of *google.com*. This process is called DNS resolution.
