# Virtualization
Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the actual hardware.

## How virtualization works?

Software called **hypervisors** separate the physical resources from the virtual environmentsâ€”the things that need those resources.

- Hypervisors can sit on top of an operating system (like on a laptop) or be installed directly onto hardware (like a server), which is how most enterprises virtualize. 

- Hypervisors take your physical resources and divide them up so that virtual environments can use them.
